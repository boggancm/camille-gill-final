## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to examine accessibility and choice of amenities in family neighborhoods across income-levels. Specifically, we focused our analysis on two areas: the West planning district and the Central planning district. Regarding amenities, we are primarily concerned with those that are necessary for the wellbeing of families: schools, banks, libraries, clinics, doctors, pharmacies, child care facilities, police stations and post offices. We recognize that other amenities may be import to families’ livelihoods, but chose to focus on these nine for the sake of simplicity. We evaluate accessibility in terms of distance (in meters) to the closest amenity and choice in terms of distance (in meters) to the fifth closest amenity. Using these metrics, we created ‘accessibility scores’ and ‘choice scores’ for each neighborhood for both walking and driving to amenities. In comparing these scores, we ultimately found walking allowed for greater accessibility in both neighborhoods and greater choice in the West planning district. We also found that the West district scored better in terms of accessibility and choice for both mode types. Therefore, we believe the West district is more conducive to family households. 

## Research Questions

* Does the accessibility of amenities vary by neighborhood? 
* Does the choice of amenities vary by neighborhood?
* How does accessibility differ when driving vs. walking to amenities in each neighborhood?
* How does choice differ when driving vs. walking to amenities in each neighborhood?
