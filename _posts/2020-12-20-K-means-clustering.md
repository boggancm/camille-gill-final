## K-means clustering to determine areas with family households

The maps below are visualizations of the k-means clustering algorithm we employed to identify areas in Philadelphia with high proportions of households with children and low median incomes. The second map includes an overlay of the Philadelphia Planning Commission's planning districts, which we used to narrow down the scope of our analysis.
